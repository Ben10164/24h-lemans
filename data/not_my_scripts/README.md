# READ ME

These scripts were made by the lovely person Georgi D. Sotirov.

All the scripts do is parse through the wikipedia data that I made my own script to scrap. Since the data not being fictional isnt a requirement for the project, I hope that this isn't counted as any sort of academic dishonesty.

As to not redistribute the code that someone else has written, I have added the files to .gitignore and will instead link to the raw text files found in the repo.
